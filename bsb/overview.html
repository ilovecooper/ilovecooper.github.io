      	According to Wikipedia, the definition of cooking is the " art, science and craft of using heat to make food more palatable, digestible, nutritious, or safe. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions."

    Why Start Cooking
    </h1>
    <p1 class="text">
      You might be thinking, why should I start cooking? Can't I just go to like a fast-food place like McDonald's® and get myself a big mac. Why waste my time cooking instead? Well, in our opinion, cooking brings people together. You can spend time with your family and cook, and even it is a small dish, it could be a blast, no matter if it was a success or not. It can also reduce stress and can get you to get more creative with what you make. According to the article, "12 Reasons You Should Learn How to Cook" by Chef Alli, it states, "Once you begin to embrace the creativity that cooking has to offer, you’ll start seeing recipes as guidelines instead of written rules set in stone. Before you know it, you’ll be mixing things up with different ingredients and flavor combinations as you explore new cuisines." Like I said earlier, you can get more time or relaxation and get as creative as you like.

    How To Start Cooking
    </h1>
    <p1 class="text">
      Well, to start cooking, you have to gather materials. You have to know your utensils, and you also have to know measurements to cook. You also have to learn how to be patient. When you cook, you have to be patient and as I like to say, trust the process. Cooking takes time and has to be precise. 
Another way to start cooking is to buy a beginner’s cookbook. We recommend this because a cookbook is very precise with instructions and what ingredients are needed and the process is also very well explained. According to “How to Start Cooking at Home” by Proline Rangers, it states, “... But, it is a great idea to make a mental note of recipes that you’re willing to cook. Starting off, you might only be cooking 2-3 recipes. But, as you get better at cooking at home, you may want to save them somewhere."
	You can also start cooking by watching tutorials on Youtube, Instagram, Facebook etc. We suggest that you start with simpler recipes, and you can get more complex.

    If You Already Know How to Cook, How to get BETTER at it
    </h1>
    <p1 class="text">
      You can get better at cooking in multiple ways. According to “21 Home Cooking Skills: How to Become a Better Cook” by Leith’s Online Cookery Recipes, it states, “Learning to taste and adjust seasoning is one of the most important chef skills. It’s an indispensable skill you can practice to improve your home cooking. A pinch of salt, a squeeze of lemon or a sprinkling of chilli flakes is often all it takes to lift a dish.” Learning how to taste can make a vast difference in your cooking, and it can make it much better. Like it states, a little too much of salt can ruin the whole dish. This is why tasting the dish is so important when you cook. The article also states that “the secret to cooking is sourcing the best ingredients you can find. Familiarise yourself with the seasonal growing calendar, so you only use fruit and vegetables at their peak. Choose vegetables without wilted or discoloured leaves, bruising, or other signs of damage.” Like the article states, we advise you to use the best type of ingredients you can find, because the better the quality of the ingredients, the better dish you just made.
